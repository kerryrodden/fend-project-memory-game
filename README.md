# Memory Game Project

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a project from [Udacity's Front-End Developer nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

## Instructions

This is a simple card game to test memory, in the style of [Concentration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)). In each turn, you can click on two cards to flip them over, and try to find the pairs of matching symbols. The fewer turns you take to complete the game, the higher your score will be.

## Contributing

This was a course project and was put onto Github for grading, so unfortunately I cannot accept contributions. Thank you!
